# DS-ALGO
This repo is full of interesting data structure and algorithm problems which are asked in technical interviews.
These problems can be solved using various well known algorithms, modification of these popular algorithms or custom data structures. 
Also, we'll try to write clean Java code which will be readable and reusable.
Feel free to contribute, fork and discuss the code here on Github.
